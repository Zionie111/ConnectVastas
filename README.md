# ConnectVistas: Your Gateway to the Digital 

**Introduction**

ConnectVistas is on a mission to revolutionize access to digital resources in low-income and remote communities across Malawi. We strive to empower individuals by providing affordable and reliable connectivity, coupled with cutting-edge digital tools. Our mission goes beyond conventional internet services; we are committed to instilling a sense of digital literacy through tailor-made activities, workshops, and immersive experiences.

We are driven by the vision of creating a future where every individual, regardless of their economic standing and geographical location, has access to the digital world and is equipped with the skills and knowledge to thrive in it. Through our personalized approach to skills development and community engagement, ConnectVistas aims to break down the barriers of the internet and pave the way for a more inclusive, digitally empowered society. 

**Mission**

Our mission is to transform lives and foster sustainable development, leaving no one behind in the digital revolution.

**Problem Statement**

According to the Ernst & Young LLP 2021 report, Malawi faces challenges in its underdeveloped ICT sector. More than half of households have mobile phones, but only 16.4% have access to the Internet. Additionally, a mere 4.2% of households own a computer, laptop, or tablet. This underlines inequitable access to internet services, a lack of awareness of ICT and e-services, and a deficiency of digital skills and competencies among the workforce. These statistics are concerning, particularly given Malawi's higher youthful population, which should ideally benefit from digital dividends to eradicate poverty effectively. Even more concerning is the fact that the Smart Phones and Laptops are mainly with people in urban areas who account for only less than 20% of the total population. This implies that there is more that has to be done to ensure that Malawi is not left behind in the current digital revolution

**Solution**

ConnectVistas is committed to transforming lives, one connection at a time. Our solution involves establishing affordable community Wi-Fi centers with state-of-the-art digital tools in low-income and remote areas. Beyond internet connectivity, ConnectVistas incorporates digital literacy training, workshops, and virtual/live tours. These centers also serve as resource hubs, providing offline and online information on various topics from academics to business.
